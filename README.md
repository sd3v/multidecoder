# Multi Encoder/Decoder

## Overview
This web application provides a simple and intuitive interface for encoding and decoding strings using various algorithms. The app includes support for popular algorithms like Base64, ROT13, ASCII, Hexadecimal, SHA-256, and more.

Users can toggle between 'Encode' and 'Decode' modes to transform input data using selected algorithms. The application is designed to be responsive and supports both light and dark modes for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports algorithms such as Base64, ROT13, Hexadecimal, ASCII, Binary, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, AES, and DES.
- **Dark Mode**: Switch between light and dark themes to reduce eye strain.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-time Encoding/Decoding**: See the results of transformations instantly.

## How to Use
1. Select one or more algorithms from the dropdown menu.
2. Enter a string in the text input field.
3. Toggle between "Encode" and "Decode" modes using the switch in the header.
4. The results for each selected algorithm will appear below in the results grid.
